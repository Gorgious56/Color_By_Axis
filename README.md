# Color By Axis - Blender Add-on

Color by Axis is a Blender add-on that allows you to check whether the edges of an object are aligned with the X, Y or Z axis, by creating a color overlay.

âš  This add-on is still a work in progress.

## How it works

The add-on will create a Panel in the N-Panel, called Color by Axis. The panel has three items:
- Color by Axis button:
  - **It only works in "Edit Mode".**
  - Activates the operator that creates the overlay.  
  - Once created, it will allow will to navigate the viewport, but will be turned off as soon as you type or click.

- Axis type option:
  - GLOBAL: Compare your object's edges with global axis.
  - LOCAL: Compare your object's edges with its local axis.
  - REFERENCE: Compare your object's edges with a selected reference object. Won't work if no object is selected.

- Reference object:
  - Select the object which will be used by the REFERENCE axis type.

## Quick example
Add a default cube and enter "Edit Mode". Click the button "Color by Axis" in the N-panel. The edges of the cube will be colored according to the axis that they are parallel to.

By rotating 30 degrees in the Z axis, in "Object Mode", there are no edges parallel to X or Y axis anymore:

If "LOCAL" Axis Type is selected, it will color the edges based on the local coordinates of the objects.

If "REFERENCE" Axis Type is selected, you have to choose another object for reference. It will color the edges based on the local coordinates of the reference object.

Works with multiple objects:
